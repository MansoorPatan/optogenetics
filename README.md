# Optical Switching Of A Channel Rhodopsin-2 Protein Integrated Neuron
# Neuro Electronics, Opto-genetics
Optogenetics is a newly emerging field where selective neurons of brain are genetically modified with light sensitive proteins like ChR-2. This genetically modified neuron can respond to the pulses of light. This opens up a new era where activities of brain can be controlled using pulses of light. During the research, a neuron modified with ChR-2 protein has been modeled as an electronic circuitry and simulated the optical response across various frequencies and pulse widths.
